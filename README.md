# About

## Log a cat (logacat.com)

After taking so many "take-home assessments", I decided to start this open source project to avoid having to take a brand new assessment.

Technically this project aims to show the knowledge of the following technologies:

- TypeScript
- Node.js
- PostgreSQL
- Docker
- React
- AWS
- Pulumi


# Features

## Sign up and Sign in

The User should be able to create an account and sign in.

## Adding a new cat

A user should be able to add a new cat to their profile with the following information:

- name
- breed
- color
- nickname
- favorite snack
- favorite toy
- display in the feed (public/private)


## Adding pictures and videos

A user should be able to add pictures and videos of their cat, and they should be able to mark the video/picture as public.


## List cats

A user should be able to see a list of all the cats they have added and be able to update their info

## Cat feed

Any user should be able to see all of the other cats that are marked as public and see their videos/pictures that are also marked as public.

# Structure

The project will be structured as a mono repo with the following main folders:



| name | description                                                                                         |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| api  | The API folder contains the nodejs api that with all the required endpoints for the website to work |
| app  | The app folder contains the React app that will be used to render the website                       |

# Contributing

So far this is a personal project that hasn't been deployed to production yet, however as soon as anybody else wants to jump in and collaborate we can talk and define what that means.
